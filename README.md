# Real_Estate_Search
This is my first project on Github. Please share with me openly if you have any suggestions or criticisms.

Description: This project uses the free version of the Zillow API from Rapid API in order to search more efficiently for the more estates at once, and the final output will be written down automatically in a Excel file. 
Prerequisites: The user must download these four modules before using it: pandas, openpyxl, requests, and python-dotenv. 
Moreover, since the program is based on Zillow API, the user must also subscribe to it and obtain a x_rapidapi_key before using it. I recommend to store it in a .env file in the same folder. REMINDER: The free version of the Zillow API has a limit of 100 requests per month, but that already suffices the basic needs.
